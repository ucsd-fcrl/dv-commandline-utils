Time Efficiency:
- Best, Average, and Worst Case: O(n log(n))

Memory Efficiency:
- Naive: O(N) -- Duplicate data in heap
- Best: O(1) -- In place

Notes:
- Based on the `heap' data structure, which is a complete, binary tree
- Highest priority node is always placed at the root.
- Not stable (doesn't preserve order of equal elements)
